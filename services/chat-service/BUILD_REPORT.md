LifeStrands Chat Service â€” Build & Stability Report

Status Summary
- Containerization: Dockerfile present (python:3.11-slim), builds cleanly.
- Compose: Service defined with port 8002:8002 and required envs; matches code.
- Health: Added docker-compose healthcheck for GET /health.
- Networking: Uses host.docker.internal for LM Studio; extra_hosts set in compose.

Stability Notes
- App defines FastAPI app and uvicorn.run on 0.0.0.0:8002; EXPOSE aligns.
- Uses Redis and Postgres URLs from env; defaults provided at compose.
- WebSocket endpoints present and CORS middleware configured.

Improvements (Applied)
- Compose healthcheck added to fail fast on boot issues.

Improvements (Backlog)
- Consider adding a lightweight `/ready` that verifies DB/Redis connectivity (distinct from `/health`).
- Optional: Add `POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_CREATE=false` or pip cache mount to speed builds; current image is already slim.

Validation
- Unit tests added to assert /health responds via TestClient.
- New integration smoke test pings /health on the mapped port.
