LifeStrands Gateway Service â€” Build & Stability Report

Status Summary
- Containerization: Dockerfile (python:3.11-slim) present; builds cleanly.
- Compose: Service defined with port 8000:8000 and required service URLs; matches code.
- Health: Added docker-compose healthcheck for GET /health.

Stability Notes
- EXPOSE 8000 aligns with uvicorn.run on 0.0.0.0:8000.
- CORS and rate limiting present; routes proxy to internal services via env URLs.

Improvements (Applied)
- Compose healthcheck added.

Improvements (Backlog)
- Consider gateway-level `/ready` that verifies downstream /health to surface aggregate readiness.
- Optionally enable structured logging config through env.

Validation
- Unit test added for /health via TestClient.
- Integration smoke test pings /health on mapped port.
