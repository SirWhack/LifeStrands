LifeStrands Monitor Service â€” Build & Stability Report

Status Summary
- Containerization: Dockerfile present; installs curl and runs on python:3.11-slim.
- Compose: Service defined with port 8005:8005; mounts docker.sock read-only for container metrics.
- Health: Added docker-compose healthcheck for GET /health.

Stability Notes
- EXPOSE 8005 aligns with uvicorn.run on 0.0.0.0:8005.
- Tracks service URLs and emits metrics/alerts; gateway may proxy monitoring websocket.

Improvements (Applied)
- Compose healthcheck added.

Improvements (Backlog)
- If docker.sock is not required in some deployments, gate it behind a compose profile.
- Consider Prometheus scrape endpoint exposition details in README.

Validation
- Unit test added for /health via TestClient.
- Integration smoke test pings /health on mapped port.
