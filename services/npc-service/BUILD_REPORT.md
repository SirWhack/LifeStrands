LifeStrands NPC Service â€” Build & Stability Report

Status Summary
- Containerization: Multi-stage Dockerfile (builder + runtime) present; non-root user; builds cleanly.
- Compose: Service defined with port 8003:8003 and envs; matches code.
- Health: Added docker-compose healthcheck for GET /health.

Stability Notes
- EXPOSE 8003 aligns with uvicorn.run on 0.0.0.0:8003.
- Uses Postgres/Redis and LM Studio URLs from env; defaults provided.
- HEALTHCHECK existed in Dockerfile; compose healthcheck added for Docker parity.

Improvements (Applied)
- Compose healthcheck added for consistent orchestration behavior.

Improvements (Backlog)
- Consider trimming apt packages in build stage; runtime already minimal.
- Provide a `/ready` endpoint verifying DB connectivity for better readiness semantics.

Validation
- Unit test added for /health via TestClient.
- Integration smoke test pings /health on mapped port.
