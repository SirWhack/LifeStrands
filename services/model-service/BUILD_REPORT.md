LifeStrands Model Service â€” Build & Stability Report

Status Summary
- Containerization: Dockerfile.lmstudio provided for LM Studio proxy mode; not included in main docker-compose by design.
- Compose: Stack points to LM Studio via host.docker.internal; no model-service container is orchestrated.
- Health: Application exposes /health at port 8001 when run; monitoring references it.

Stability Notes
- App can run in LM Studio mode (env LM_STUDIO_MODE=true) pointing to LM Studio API at :1234.
- Monitoring and gateway reference the service through host ports; docs align with hybrid deployment.

Improvements (Backlog)
- Optionally add a `docker-compose.native-model.yml` entry for model-service using Dockerfile.lmstudio for teams preferring full containerization.
- Add explicit healthcheck block if/when the service is added to compose.

Validation
- Unit test added to import FastAPI app and assert /health via TestClient.
- Integration smoke test includes model-service /health (skips if not running).
