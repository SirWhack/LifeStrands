Chat Interface (Frontend) â€” Build & Stability Report

Status Summary
- Containerization: Dockerfile (node:18-alpine) builds Vite app and serves via `serve` on port 3000.
- Compose: Service defined with port 3001:3000 and env placeholders; build runs successfully.

Stability Notes
- App currently hard-codes localhost API/WS endpoints in code; this works for local compose because backend ports are published on the host.

Improvements (Backlog)
- Introduce Vite env variables (VITE_API_BASE_URL, VITE_WS_URL) and read via `import.meta.env` for flexibility across environments.
- Optionally replace `serve` with an Nginx static container for performance, if needed.

Validation
- Integration smoke test exercises backend /health endpoints; UI build is validated by `npm run build` in Dockerfile.
